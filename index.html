    <h3>Painting.</h3>
    <p>I used to draw pictures when I was a child whenever I had the time. This was one of my earliest hobbies and also one of my favorites.</p>
    <img class="music" src="music.png" alt="music-img">
    <h3>Music.</h3>
    <p>I love listening to music when I'm bored or even when I don't know what to do. I have created different playlists, and when I listen to a new song that I like, I add it to a playlist so I can listen to it often.</p>
    <img class="editing" src="editing.png" alt="editing-img">
    <h3>Editing and VFX.</h3>
    <p>I enjoy editing photos and videos, as well as adding visual effects to them. Recently, I started learning VFX, and I aim to master it.</p>
    <img class="anime" src="anime.png" alt="anime-img">
    <h3>Watching Anime.</h3>
    <p>I am an anime fan. I often watch anime, next to listening to music. My favorite anime series are <strong>Hunter X Hunter, Code Geass and One Piece</strong>.</p>

    <p>I like to learn facts and discover new things. I believe that this habit enhances my memory power. I'm trying to gain knowledge in as many fields as possible.</p>
